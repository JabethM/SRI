This folder holds the data and configurations for the three variants case.
Each directory name refers to strong relationships. (AB) means that variants A and B are highly related whilst C is weakly related to both
The choice of these specifically is because I assume any other combinations will not be that interesting.
In each of these cases, A comes first, followed by B followed by C.
